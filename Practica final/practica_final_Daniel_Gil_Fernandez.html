            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would
            tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could
            use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that
            he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many
            abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing
            his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,
            then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself
